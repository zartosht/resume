Welcome to my developer portfolio template with HTML, CSS and JS üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ. Free to use and easy to customize.  
Here you have a snapshot of how it looks like.

This is a template made for developers to use it as a landing page üíª. To see the live demo visit [guimg.github.io/dev-portfolio/](https://guimg.github.io/dev-portfolio/s).

## Usage

This template is fully customazible. To change your profile info, go to: `data/data.js`.
Within the file you'll find a Javascript object which contains all the profile data. Change the fields to your current one and once it's done, üí• boom, refresh üîÅ the page and üëÅ see the magic.

### Example

This is a reduced version of the profile object:

```javascript
var profile = {
  name: "Guim Gonz√°lez",
  position: "Blockchain and FullStack developer",
  email: "guim.gonzalez@gmail.com",
  location: "Barcelona, Spain",
  birth: "1997-07-26"
};
```

Let's change the profile information to `John's Doe`:

```javascript
// My new profile
var profile = {
  name: "John Doe",
  position: "Web developer and cake lover",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  location: "San Francisco, CA",
  birth: "1989-09-06"
};
```

Done ‚úÖ the new profile is ready. Try yours! üî•

### Changing color

Don't like the color? üë®‚Äçüé® Try changing to new themes, here you have a list of them:

- Nightsky
- Sunset
- Purpledream
- Cutekitty

```javascript
let page = {
  theme: "nightsky"
  // ^ themes suported:
  //  - nightsky (default)
  //  - sunset
  //  - purpledream
  //  - cutekitty
};
```

> In this first version you can't change the language yet. Soon I'll commit new updates.
