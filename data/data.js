  bio:
    `
    I've been programming since 2012. First I started coding with python for learning security, running pentests and to create automated tests (because I love it when computers do jobs for meüòÅ).
    <br>After python I learned ruby for using it with metasploit. Then I came across web development and just like everyone in this business, I started with PHP language and started coding in pure PHP (No OOP and anything! Dirty as hell!).
    I found wordpress and very soon, get bored and started working with Laravel version 4. I created my first web application with Laravel, and stayed in PHP till now. Used Symfony, Phalcon, CodeIgniter and ... along my journey through PHP.
    I developed my skills as programming languages developed. Learned NodeJS and started using AdonisJS because it was a great replica of the Laravel but in Javascript language.
    Worked with Express, Next, Nest and developed many microservice and projects.
    Personally I love developing smart applications, automated tasks, crawlers, fixing bugs and find a way to break the computer rules.
    I'm a Back-end developer who has experience with creating, maintaining and implementing everything from databases to web pages.
    I nerd out when learning new programming languages functionality feels giddy when finding /destroying bugs.
    I like to face new challenges in every field in my career and I'm not afraid of them.
