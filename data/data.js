    "I'm a Backend developer primarily working NodeJS (TypeScript and NestJS) with a rich background in working with PHP.",
  bio:
    `
    <p>I've been programming since <strong>2012</strong>. I started with PHP language and started coding in pure <strong>PHP</strong> (No OOP and anything! Dirty as hell!). I found WordPress and very soon, get bored and started working with <strong>Laravel</strong> version 4. I created my first web application with <strong>Laravel</strong>. I developed my skills as programming languages developed.</p>
<p>Then I learned <strong>NodeJS</strong> and started using <strong>AdonisJS</strong> because it was an excellent replica of <strong>Laravel</strong> but in <strong>Javascript</strong>. Worked with <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Fastify</strong>, <strong>NestJS</strong> and created many microservice and projects and stayed in <strong>NestJS</strong> (<strong>TypeScript</strong>) till now.</p>
<p>I love developing innovative applications, automated tasks, crawlers, fixing bugs, and find a way to break the computer rules. I'm a <strong>Back-end developer</strong> who has experience creating, maintaining, and implementing everything from databases (<strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>Postgres</strong>, <strong>MongoDB</strong>) to messaging (<strong>Redis</strong>, <strong>Kafka</strong>) to web pages.</p>
<p>I nerd out when learning new programming languages functionality feels giddy when finding /destroying <strong>bugs</strong>. I like to face new challenges in every field in my career, and I'm not afraid of them.</p>
